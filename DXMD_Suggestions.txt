If there was proper mod tools, many of these could be easily implemented :)

NPC INTERACTION
- Let we give credits to beggars, their reaction could be to give like 25experience, or let them just thanks, or unlock access to someone in the sewers side quest.
- Richard The Great: staying too long under his influence could create a "end of game" condition where the player would sit there and not leave. (*4)

ITEMS INTERACTION
- pick up items hightlight should have 3 choices: 0-nothing, 1-only consumables, 2-everything. Also, consumables should be highlighted in another color like yellow or custom. So many highlighted items in white is annoying.
- pickupable items highlight should be configurable to be less annoying/disrupting the marvelous game visuals, I would use grey or may be dark red color to not disturb the vision.
- all pickupable items should have HP, so we would not be able to use a trash bin as powerful supreme high tech shield against a ceiling turret. So metal items should have like from 5x to 10x more HP than wooden, but not be indestructible!!!
- when picking up a gun you already have, it should auto disassemble it to avoid having to drop our gun, pick it up, disassemble and pick up back our upgraded gun (*3)
- everytime you destroy some box, there should have a small chance 5% for it to drop a consumable or ammo or even a gun

INVENTORY
- guns are thin, not bulky, so a sniper rifle with of 3, with non optional height of 2, shall be considered as 6 inv slots. based on that, a pistol shall be only 2 slots, so h2w1 (2 slots). a combat rifle can be h2w2 (4 slots). grenade launcher is bulky tho 2x4. All ammo boxes should be 1x1 slots only. WORKAROUND: So, in the end, as we cant access all width values, a way to workaround that and compensate for the other items is to make small everything that we can, so all weapons that were possible became h2w1, ugly but is what happens when we have no modding tools :P. TIP: after apply the values, to let the binary editor update the shown values, just re-open the file, no need to close it.

COMBAT
- items on the environment, like big cardboxes or anything that a firearm could destroy should be destructible, so we would not be able to use as cover. Ok, the idea could be cardboxes may contain something strong inside, but some of them, or other things may be fragile.
- regenerating health should consume battery energy the same amount and prevent batt regen for a short time as if a skill had been used
- let grenade launcher ammo be converted into related grenades, so we dont need to carry the launcher but will still be able to use it's ammo. (*2)
- shoot thru walls: just calc how far inside the wall the bullet will travel, if it is less than 0.10m, let it go thru, as long it is armor piercing. Sniper armor piercing bullets could go thru 0.25m. Reduce damage to 33% of max.
- (*4) the device Richard uses to interfere in augmented ppl could become a gun used against the player (for a short time random aug disable for example) and that the player could use to debuff or control augmented ppl for a short time (like turrets and robots are hacked)
- Reaction time of law enforcers should be 0.25s. Thugs 0.25-0.5s. AICameras, AITurrets, AIRobots 0.1s. Civilians Vanilla 3s(?). Using Cloak augmentation (should have reaction too) 9s. Advanced Cloak 18s.

NAVIGATION
- optional map fog, on every depth level, so we could know where we already walked thru, what places we visited, to make it less labiryntic to move thru maps, sewers etc, after all we have not the movement and positional sensation as IRL.

HACKING
- configurable data storage credits and software rewards. lvl 5 should be 5x more than lvl1 nodes, so from 100 to 500 credits and from 1 to 5 softwares, 5x more xp WORKAROUND in the shell script DXMD_randomSoftwareReward.sh (*1)

ENVIRONMENT
- take damage if we step over any fire or any heat source, even the ones we can turn on/off like electric ovens. An open microwave oven if turned on should be a hazard.
- double click the zoom in iron sights key while wielding no weapons, could eagle eye zoom like best sniper rifle scope (may be less :))
- destructible computer terminals (bullet proof terminals if they contain main story quest data. Side quest ones could be resistant but not indestructible) and electronic lock terminals (bullet proof terminals if doors cannot be destroyed)

======================================= MOD: IMHO Fair and balanced gameplay INSTRUCTIONS

Why "instructions"? because we do not have tools to mod DeusEx properly. We can tweak binary files that fortunately are uncompressed, so there is still hope to modding but it is very difficult (to me at least) to guess the right byte offset to tweak, very time consuming too to make tests. TODO: May be try with Cheat Engine?
These instructions/tips are how to play more satisfactorily in several ways.
It is balance towards maximum proper difficulty "Give me Deus Ex", because I dont have time to replay everything in "one life" mode...

COMBAT:
- If you reach a place that enemies can't reach you, it may probably be absolutely no challenge to combat them. In that case, reload and combat them where they can reach you.

BALANCE: You will need to install Debug Menu mod to properly balance the game while you play it.
- IMHO, to hacking minigame be fun, rewards should balanced and more rewarding (*1).
 + if you fail a hack attempt, explode an FIRE grenade on your feet. If you disconnect after the trace begins, throw and EMP grenade. Better face a wall first as we cant aim straight down to throw them.

AUMENTATIONS:
- do not get ICARUS nor HIGHJUMP, use Charged Dash instead, is much more challenging (despite makes it easier to climb up). That keeps high fall damage difficulty.
- do not get TITAN if you think the combat is already too easy in hardest mode.
- after Kollen, use all praxis to buy hidden augs up to 400% overload that glitches the HUD many times while in combat, great for chaotic cyberpunk roleplaying, but do not use them yet. Only use them after you get enough praxis points to buy them. To debit praxis later when you gain new ones, use CheatEngine or PINCE(linux) to determine the 4 memory locations where available praxis are stored so you can zero them. Just add a random big value of praxis to be easier to find the memory address, and reload the last savegame if you think you did something wrong.

========================================= WORKAROUNDS: using DebugMenu mod

- (*2) when you pickup a grenade launcher ammo, drop it and give self related normal grenades
- (*3) when pick up a gun you have, give self proper parts amount (it is based on vanilla gun's width x10): 
				10mm pistol: 30
				Stun Gun: 30
				Machine Pistol: 40
				Combat Rifle: 50
				Battle Rifle: 60
				Lancer Rifle: 30
				Tactical ShotGun: 50
				DevastatorShotGun: 50
				Sniper Rifle: 70
				Grenade Launcher: 40
				Cote Azur: 30
				Tranquilizer Rifle: 70
