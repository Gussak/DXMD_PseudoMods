 Q:how to fix keybinding for throwing objects in DeusEX:MD? after I customized it, it stops working, what is wrong? how to fix it?
 A:no need to reset to defaults, the throw object hotkey IS NOT CONFIGURABLE!!! It will always be the key configured to fire weapons.
 TODO: confirm if your version is the latest as it may have been fixed in the latest!
 
 Q:how to reload game faster?
 A:exit to the main menu before reloading the savegame. Exiting the game app and re-running it may be faster too! As soon reaching main menu hit Enter 2x.
 
 Q:jump key stopped working! what now?
 A:focus another app, and go back to DXMD.
 
 Q:LMB behaviour is weird in menus, how to fix?
 A:assign it to nothing, so it will work great in menus but not for anything else in game, what is not a real problem.
 
 Q:unable to holster my gun?
 A:move away from where you are standing, some places prevent that like +- in front of the Bank...
 
 Q:some containers are highlighted but wont open, why?
 A:try to go thru the stealth path, it may have a trigger there that was tested by devs. Try to move all around, it may trigger something that fix the container.
 
 Q:debug menu options to add 50 and 100 credits, that worked initially, now only add 5 and 10? I use it to compensate not being able to take duplicate guns I gather from combats to vendor, here is the list of empty ammo gun's values from vendor Tars:
	10mm pistol: 200
	Stun Gun: 625
	Machine Pistol: 300
	Combat Rifle: 250
	Battle Rifle: 750
	Lancer Rifle: 1125
	Tactical ShotGun: 750
	DevastatorShotGun: 1125
	Sniper Rifle: 1250
	Grenade Launcher: 1500
	Cote Azur: 1000
	Tranquilizer Rifle: 
 A:use a mouse with turbo click. Each second you hold it is like 10 clicks, so 100 credits. Or if 25 is still 25, each second is 250 credits. Now is easy, just count how many seconds you are trying to add 100*Seconds or 250*seconds credits
